    <h1>Three Websites Analysis</h1>
    <p>These are the three websites that I have visited very often this semester. I will be analysing it based on the design and also my personal experience using it with no bias at all.</p>
    
    <h2>Two Great Websites</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.carroll.edu" target="_blank">Carroll College</a>
            <p>I chose Carroll College not because I'm biased, but because I have had a good personal experience browsing through it since before I even got here. But first, I will start analysing the website by the design first and also talking about how easy it was for me to navigate and look through what I wanted.</p>
            <p>Starting off at the home page, I really like the scrolling effect the website has where it shows the word "Your Journey Matters" that was transparent and as you scroll down you can see the picture of a woman climbing which I thought was cool. Another effect I saw was the "Grow with purpose" section where the image was moving a little when I was scrolling and it has a color that makes the text stoodout. Besides from that, I just feel like it's kind of bland like there could be some more creativity or more interactions can be put in there like a button in the middle or something like that. I do notice all the buttons at the top which are easy to navigate, but it could be better if there is like an "Apply now" button bigger in the home page itself rather than scrolling down to the Let's Get Started section. I also found the color very appealing especially the main color purple and the use of white and beige for the texts to make it standout.</p>
            <p>The website is using HTML5 and all the code looks fine to me. The layout looks good, the spacing are all even, and 2 columns with pictures on one side and text on the other side. I do not notice any table elements being used in the home page but I do noticed with the Directory site. It was when I lost my headphones and someone wrote on the whiteboard in Simperman 101 that if you lost your headphones in this class, contact Dr. Almquist. I did not know who Dr. Almquist was and there are quite a few people whose last name was Almquist. So I went to the directory section and saw the table of names and their job title and that was how I was able to get Dr. Travis Almquist's contact info and get my headphones back. This shows that I was able to navigate through the websites really well and was able to find what I was looking for. </p>
            <p>The little detail I noticed is the arrow pointing down from the "Your Journey Matters" and it kind goes through the Carroll College logo. It is kind of like pointing down to tell you to scroll down and read more while also having that scrolling effect as you scroll which I thought was interesting.</p>
        </li>
    
        <li><a href="https://www.kayak.com" target="_blank">Kayak</a>
            <p>Kayak is another example of a well-functioning site, but in a completely different way than Carroll College. The focus here is entirely on getting you from point A to point B as fast as possible. I like the site because it’s designed for quick searches flights, hotels, and everything is front and center. As I scroll down, there is no scrolling effect but I do notice that the search bar to enter for flights, dates, and all that are frozen on top no matter how far down you scroll to. This is really helpful for those who want to look through the information while also seeing the flight information that they have entered. This is probably the one little small detail that set this website apart from the others.</p>
            <p>Same as Carroll College's website, Kayak also uses HTML5 and all the code looks pretty neat. The figures that they are showing looks clean with even padding and margin so it's kinda like a multiple columns going on depend on the size of your screen. Another thing that set it apart is the menu being on the left. They went for a different look with the search being on top and the menu that contrains everything else on the left instead. Personally, I think this is really convenient to navigate through. What really gets me is that when I searched for trips and saved them, the trip will be in the menu section on the left as well. This makes it easy for me to just find it with just one click first thing on the website. The colors are simple with white, orange, and black which works because it keeps the focus on the search results. There’s no need for extra colors here since it’s all about functionality and usually people already know what they are looking for when they come to the website.</p>
            <p>One downside of Kayak is that the site’s design feels very utilitarian. It’s great for what it does, but visually, it’s not appealing. It’s not a website that wows you or makes you want to explore. The layout is a bit repetitive, and while that helps with usability, it can also feel boring. There are no hover effects, or any other effects really and it just feels bland. A little more design effort could make it both functional and visually interesting.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>One Terrible Website</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.aurafragrance.com" target="_blank">Aura Fragance</a>
            <p>Now, Aura Fragrance is the opposite of Kayak and Carroll College. The only reason why I would go on this website is beacuse they have some of the most affordable prices for fragrance out there. I would just have a specific perfume in mind and would just search and find it without browsing at all. The reason is that the website looks very outdated. The single-column layout stretches the content too wide across the screen, making it hard to read. There’s no real structure to it, so it’s easy to get lost, and the navigation isn’t intuitive. There’s no scrolling effect, and everything feels static, which feels kinda clunky. So it doesn't really help to browse for anything at all.</p>
            <p>They also use HTML5 like the two good websites I have mentioned. However, their codes don't look as neat as the other two. For example, when I search for something and a bunch of fragrance poped up. They didn't use figures nor tables, but div for all the products. They create different div for different products, put the img element in it, and a seperate paragraph below it for the name of the product. As a result, they didn't look very appealing and the columns are all too close to each other and there’s no sense of space between sections, making everything feel cramped. I tried to make the browsing tab go small as well and instead of pushing the figures down smoothly, the texts and images were just distorted until I sized down to the smallest I could, it would just reduce to just 2 products instead. This means that the code only works for 2 display and that is for a computer screen and a phone screen there's no in between (this is kind of hard to explain unless I show you what I meant). The color scheme is also a disaster. There’s this weird mix of purple, pink, and gray and the background is just white which makes all the products look cheap and random. </p>
            <p>What makes this site worse is the lack of attention to the little things. There is absolutely nothing I like about this website other than the offers it has. The home page are just images and some texts. Although the menu shows a bunch of stuffs like new arrivals, best selling, and all that, they could also just put them in the home page so that people can browse, stay on the website for longer and that leads to people buying even more. There’s no hover effect on the buttons, and the buttons themselves are flat and uninviting. The fonts aren’t well-chosen and sometimes they aren't even centered like the names of the products. Overall, it feels like the site was thrown together without any real thought, and it’s in desperate need of a redesign. Maybe they know that people would visit the website anyway to get a specific one that they already know and because they sell them for cheaper than other shops that's why they didn't put much effort into it.</p>
