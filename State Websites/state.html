    <h1>State Websites Analysis</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><h2>Favorite State Website: <a href="https://portal.kansas.gov" target="_blank">Kansas</a></h2>
            <p>The Kansas site is my favorite for its clean and simple layout. The bright color choice (blue-ish) is nice making it visually appealing. I love how they give state facts right away like population stats, land and water area info which makes it feel both informative and welcoming. The design feels a bit outdated, like it could use a modern touch, but overall, it’s very easy to navigate. The menus are clearly labeled, which helps with accessibility. However, the site does have some speed issues; it lags a bit, which could be frustrating for users. Another thing is I tried searching "Tourism" in every state websites search box and Kansas didn't perform really well. Even with that, it offers a great balance between functionality and content, which is why it ranks at the top for me.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li><h2><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov" target="_blank">Arkansas</a></h2>
            <p>Arkansas comes second because it shows a lot of potential in terms of design, but it’s too cluttered. They have some great visual elements, but they try to do too much on one page, with text and images overlapping or scattered around. This makes it feel a bit overwhelming to use. Some of the text color choices also make readability harder, especially when placed over certain backgrounds. On the bright side, the site seems to aim for a modern and engaging look, which could be great if they simplified things a bit. If they organize the content and improved readability, it could be much more user-friendly and visually appealing. When I searched the word "Tourism" it shows a lot of suggestions in the box that I can easily navigate without having to press the word search just for tourism if that make sense. Overall, great potential but they just overdone it.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li><h2><a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html" target="_blank">Maine</a></h2>
            <p>The Maine website is functional and easy to navigate, but it feels like a relic from a few years ago like The COVID-19 response section being in the center, shows that the site hasn’t been updated recently so it looks outdated. I do like the clean design and a lot of buttons navigation that makes it easy to find information quickly. However, the overall design feels stuck in time and could really use a refresh. The layout itself works, but the visual elements like fonts and graphics make it feel like it’s from like 2018. No suggestions appeared when I typed in "Tourism" but when I press search it shows a lot of articles I can choose from, though they are still too simple. It’s efficient, but it lacks the modern look and feel that other state sites offer.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li><h2><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Maryland</a></h2>
            <p>I can definitely see Maryland’s vision in going for simplicity making the state website looks clean and the video background gives it a nice and modern touch that shows what the city of the state looks like. It adds some personality and movement, making the homepage visually appealing though they should've gone for a brighter color like the clear blue sky to make it much better. However, I feel like the menus are a bit too hidden and so it's more difficult to navigate than it should be. For a state website, I expect to see more facts about Maryland upfront, and the homepage feels empty. It’s nice to look at, but it doesn’t prioritize the user experience as much as it should. Moreover, when I searched for "Tourism" not only did it gives suggestion but also when I press on one of the article it takes me to a visually pleasing page. I really like the design there I just do not understand why they wanted to make the home page so simple. A better balance between aesthetics and accessibility would go a long way here. Despite the nice visual elements, the functionality needs some work.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li><h2>Least Favorite State Website: <a href="https://alaska.gov" target="_blank">Alaska</a></h2>
            <p>Alaska’s site is very functional, and I really like the “How Do I” section, which makes navigation straightforward especially for those who just want to get things done. It’s clear they focused on making the site usable, which is great. But the design feels really old almost like you’re visiting a site from the early 2000s. The outdated look, and the poor use of space, makes it less visually appealing. It feels like it’s lagging behind in terms of modern web design, even though the features themselves work well. It's almost like visiting a sketchy website, especially when you’re looking for official state information. If they put efforts in the design, it could be much more inviting. Another downside of the Alaska state website is that they don't have a chatbot regardless of it being AI or live like other websites. For all these reasons, I put Alaska last for the list of state websites.</p>
